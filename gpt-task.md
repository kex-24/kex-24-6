# Elephant Sanctuary

For this programming exercise, you will practice modeling objects in Java. You will work with Java classes, constructors, fields (variables within a class), methods (functions within a class), and more. This exercise will help you understand how to design and implement classes in an object-oriented programming language.

## Deadline
This work should be completed before the next class.

## Instructions
Please refer to the assignments section of the course website for instructions on how to do and submit the assignment.

## Preparation

- Read and work through Chapter 2: Looking Inside Classes.
- Access the course material through the course website or directly via provided links.

## Learning Goals

This week, we aim to familiarize you with the following concepts:
* Designing Java classes.
* Adding instance fields.
* Writing a constructor method.
* Implementing getters and setters.
* Utilizing the dot operator.
* Printing information to the terminal.
* Using the `main` method.
* Understanding scope and variable shadowing.

## Assignment

Imagine a sanctuary dedicated to the care and protection of elephants. Your task is to model these magnificent creatures in Java. You need to create an `Elephant` class that encapsulates the characteristics and behaviors of an elephant.

### Exercise 1: Getting Started

Create a new Java file called `Elephant.java` in the `src` folder. This file will define the `Elephant` class.

### Exercise 2: Fields

Add fields to your Elephant class to represent its name, age, weight, and whether or not it is currently asleep. You don't need to assign values to these fields just yet.

### Exercise 3: Constructor

Write a constructor for the Elephant class. The constructor should allow you to set initial values for the elephant's name, age, weight, and asleep status when you create an instance of the class.

### Exercise 4: Getters and Setters

Implement getters and setters for each field in your class. This will allow you to access and modify the elephant's properties safely.

### Exercise 5: Creating Elephants

In the `main` method of your Elephant class, create several instances of the Elephant class, using the constructor you defined. Set each elephant's attributes to values of your choosing.

### Exercise 6: The `printInfo` Method

Add a method named `printInfo` to your Elephant class. This method should print all the current information about the elephant to the console.

### Exercise 7: Interaction among Elephants

Introduce a method in your Elephant class that simulates an interaction between elephants. For example, you can create a method that simulates one elephant trumpeting to greet another elephant. This method should update the state of the elephants in some way and print a description of the interaction.

### Exercise 8: Understanding Scope

Investigate how Java's scope rules work by experimenting with variable shadowing within your class. Pay specific attention to how the `this` keyword can be used to prevent shadowing.

## Checklist

- Implement the `Elephant` class with the specified fields.
- Write a constructor that initializes an elephant's attributes.
- Implement getters and setters for each field.
- Create instances of your Elephant class within the `main` method.
- Implement and test the `printInfo` method.
- Create and test the method that simulates interactions between elephants.
- Examine how scope and shadowing affect your class.

Please make sure to test your program thoroughly and correct any bugs before the submission deadline.
